## About

AI Flashcards MVP targets students, professionals, and lifelong learners who value spaced repetition but are discouraged by the time cost of card creation. The application addresses common pain points in flashcard creation:

- **High time cost** to create and curate cards from raw study material
- **Inconsistent quality** when drafting cards without a review structure
- **Frustration** when tools either overcomplicate setup or lose draft work
- **Lack of clear error feedback** that slows down correction and iteration

### Key Features

- **Email/password authentication** with secure session management
- **Manual flashcard CRUD** with inline validation (front: 200 chars, back: 500 chars)
- **AI-assisted candidate generation** triggered manually by the user
- **Review queue** to accept, edit, or discard AI-generated candidates
- **Session-only persistence** for AI candidates until accepted
- **PostgreSQL database** for storing user accounts and accepted flashcards

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** v22.14.0 (use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage versions)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd 10xDevs
   ```

2. **Set the correct Node.js version**

   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

   Copy the example environment file and configure your settings:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Update `.env` with your:
   - Supabase URL and API keys
   - OpenRouter.ai API key
   - Other required configuration

5. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:4321` (or the port specified by Astro).

## Project Status

üöß **MVP Development** - Internal Demo Phase

This project is currently in active development as an MVP for internal demonstration purposes. The focus is on:

- Demonstrating end-to-end flashcard creation (manual + AI-assisted)
- Validating the review queue UX
- Ensuring data persistence and security
- Providing reliable error handling

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Users table
users:
  - id (PK)
  - email (unique)
  - password_hash
  - created_at
  - updated_at

-- Flashcards table
flashcards:
  - id (PK)
  - user_id (FK ‚Üí users.id)
  - front (max 200 chars)
  - back (max 500 chars)
  - created_at
  - updated_at
```

### Planned Features

- Integration with open-source spaced repetition algorithm
- Enhanced review and practice sessions
- Advanced card organization (sets, tags)
- Mobile applications
