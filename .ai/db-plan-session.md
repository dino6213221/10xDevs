1. Implement a unique constraint on the email column in the users table.
2. Define strict character limits for flashcard front (≤200) and back (≤500) fields at the database level.
3. Establish a one-to-many relationship between users and flashcards with cascade deletion on user removal.
4. Use PostgreSQL’s TIMESTAMP for created_at and updated_at fields to accurately track timestamps.
5. Apply indexing on critical fields such as user email, flashcard user_id, and created_at for optimized query performance.
6. Configure PostgreSQL row-level security (RLS) policies to ensure that only flashcard owners can access their data.
7. Incorporate industry-standard hashing algorithms to secure password_hash storage.
8. Consider partitioning strategies for the flashcards table based on user ID or creation date if data volume increases.
9. Prepare for a future spaced repetition integration by designing the schema to support additional tables (e.g., spaced repetition history) and relationships.
10. Add a logging or error tracking mechanism to capture errors related to AI generation and flashcard operations.

<matched_recommendations>

1. Recommendation to design an expandable spaced repetition history table to accommodate future integration.
2. Recommendation to enforce a unique constraint on the email column in the users table.
3. Recommendation to define character limits at the database level using VARCHAR restrictions or check constraints on flashcards.
4. Recommendation to implement cascade deletion between users and flashcards.
5. Recommendation to establish indexing strategies on frequently queried columns such as email, user_id, and timestamps.
6. Recommendation to use PostgreSQL TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE for all timestamp fields.
7. Recommendation to plan for table partitioning based on user behavior or data volume as needed.
8. Recommendation to implement row-level security (RLS) policies to restrict flashcard access to the owning user only.
9. Recommendation to secure sensitive data with industry-standard password hashing and secure salting techniques.
10. Recommendation to design a logging mechanism for capturing error details associated with AI generation failures and flashcard operations. </matched_recommendations>

<database_planning_summary> The database planning for the AI Flashcards MVP focuses on a minimal relational structure with two primary entities: users and flashcards. Users are required to have unique email addresses and secure password storage, while flashcards are associated via a one-to-many relationship with enforced character limits for the front (max 200 characters) and back (max 500 characters) fields. The schema is designed with performance in mind, suggesting the use of indexes on frequently accessed fields and the potential for partitioning the flashcards table based on anticipated data volume. Security is paramount, with recommendations for row-level security (RLS) policies to ensure that only the owner can access their data, as well as industry-standard password hashing for sensitive user information. Additionally, provisions are made for proper timestamp tracking using TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, cascade deletion to maintain referential integrity, and error logging to capture issues related to AI generation and flashcard operations. Future integration of spaced repetition functionality is also considered, with the schema designed to easily accommodate additional tables or fields without disrupting core functionality. </database_planning_summary>
<unresolved_issues>

1. Clarification is needed regarding the integration details for spaced repetition history and how it will relate to the flashcards table.
2. Further definition of performance monitoring, logging strategies, and threshold metrics for AI generation failures and flashcard operations is required. </unresolved_issues> </conversation_summary>
