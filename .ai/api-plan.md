## 3. Authentication and Authorization

- All endpoints require an authentication token (e.g., JWT) sent in the Authorization header.
- User accounts use email/password signup; passwords are hashed using an industry-standard algorithm before storage.
- Backend row-level security (RLS) on the flashcards table ensures that users can only access their own flashcards.
- Endpoints for flashcards and AI candidate operations enforce authenticated access to ensure data privacy.

## 4. Validation and Business Logic

- **Validation Conditions:**
  - Flashcard "front" field must not exceed 200 characters.
  - Flashcard "back" field must not exceed 500 characters.
  - Inline validation errors are returned for any text limits exceeded during create or update operations.
- **Business Logic Implementation:**
  - **User Management:** Business rules include unique email enforcement and session management with automatic clearance of transient AI candidates on logout or session expiration.
  - **Flashcard CRUD:** Manual creation, updating, and deletion of flashcards leverage standard CRUD operations with inline validations.
  - **AI Candidate Management:** AI-generated candidates are transient (stored only in session) and subject to review actions (accept, edit, discard). Idempotency is enforced on the candidate acceptance endpoint to prevent duplicate flashcard creation.
  - **Review Queue:** Provides a dedicated endpoint to view and manage AI candidates, ensuring that only accepted candidates are persisted, while others remain ephemeral.
  - **Error Handling:** All endpoints provide clear error messages with appropriate HTTP error codes, and the retry mechanism for AI generation addresses temporary failures.

This API plan is designed to integrate seamlessly with the provided tech stack (Astro with React for frontend, Supabase and PostgreSQL for backend, and Openrouter.ai for AI services) ensuring a robust, secure, and efficient MVP implementation.
