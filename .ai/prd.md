# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - AI Flashcards MVP

## 1. Product Overview

AI Flashcards MVP is a web application that reduces the friction of creating high-quality study flashcards by combining manual authoring with AI-assisted generation and an intuitive review queue. The product targets students, professionals, and lifelong learners who value spaced repetition but are discouraged by the time cost of card creation. For the MVP internal demo, the focus is on core functionality: secure user accounts, manual flashcard CRUD, manual trigger for AI-generated candidates that exist only during the session, a simple review queue to accept/edit/discard candidates, and clear error handling. PostgreSQL is used for persistent storage, and integration with an open-source spaced repetition algorithm will be planned later.

Primary objectives for the internal demo:

- Demonstrate end-to-end creation of flashcards via manual input and AI-generated candidates.
- Validate the review queue UX for accepting, editing, or discarding AI-generated candidates.
- Ensure accepted cards are stored in the userâ€™s account; unaccepted candidates are ephemeral.
- Provide reliable error handling and inline validation for input limits.

Assumptions:

- Single web application experience; mobile apps are out of scope for MVP.
- Minimal UI consistent with internal demo-level quality and usability.
- No analytics or telemetry in MVP.

## 2. User Problem

Manual flashcard creation is slow and repetitive, which discourages consistent use of spaced repetition despite its efficacy. Users need a way to quickly transform learning material into accurate flashcards and maintain a clean workflow to validate AI suggestions. Common pain points include:

- High time cost to create and curate cards from raw study material.
- Inconsistent quality when drafting cards without a review structure.
- Frustration when tools either overcomplicate setup or lose draft work.
- Lack of clear error feedback that slows down correction and iteration.

This MVP addresses these by:

- Enabling rapid AI-assisted candidate generation initiated manually by the user.
- Presenting candidates in a dedicated review queue with accept/edit/discard actions.
- Preserving only accepted cards to avoid clutter and maintain quality.
- Enforcing simple, clear input limits (front: 200 characters, back: 500 characters) with inline validation.

## 3. Functional Requirements

3.1 Accounts and Authentication

- Email/password signup, login, logout.
- Ability to change password and delete account.
- Basic session management; session expiration logs out users and clears in-session AI candidates.

  3.2 Flashcard Management (Manual)

- Create, read, update, delete flashcards stored per user in PostgreSQL.
- Flashcard fields: front (<=200 chars), back (<=500 chars), timestamps, user ownership.
- Inline validation on create/edit actions with clear error messages.
- Store in database source of flashcards (AI, manual, etc.)

  3.3 AI Flashcard Generation and Review Queue

- Users manually trigger AI generation after entering source text or selecting content.
- AI-generated candidates exist only during the active session; not stored in the database until accepted.
- Review queue interface to display candidates with actions: accept, edit, discard.
- Edit flow within the queue must enforce the same input limits as manual creation.
- Retry option on failed AI generation; show descriptive, user-friendly error messages.
- Prevent duplicate saves from rapid repeated actions (idempotent accept).
- Store in database (in separate table) statistics related to flashcard generation, e.g. duration, who generated flashcard, when accepted or discarded, etc.

  3.4 Data and Persistence

- PostgreSQL schema with minimal relational structure:
  - users: id, email (unique), password_hash, created_at, updated_at.
  - flashcards: id, user_id (FK), front, back, created_at, updated_at.
- AI-generated candidates remain in temporary session cache (not persisted) until accepted.

  3.5 Error Handling and Validation

- Inline validation errors for exceeding text limits on front/back.
- Display encountered errors to the user for all operations (auth, CRUD, AI generation).
- Provide retry on AI errors; do not auto-retry without user action in MVP.
- All errors related to Flashcard generation should be stored in the database in the way that it can be connected to specific user.

  3.6 Security and Privacy (MVP scope)

- Hash passwords with industry-standard algorithm.
- Enforce authenticated access to all flashcard operations.
- Clear all in-session AI candidates on logout or session expiration.

  3.7 Spaced Repetition Integration (Deferred)

- The specific open-source algorithm is not yet selected.
- MVP will be designed to support future integration (e.g., add fields later without breaking core flows).
- No practice review session required for MVP; focus remains on candidate review and card CRUD.

  3.8 Performance and Reliability (MVP constraints)

- No specific latency SLAs; prioritize reliability and clear error reporting.
- Manual trigger for AI limits unnecessary API usage.

## 4. Product Boundaries

In Scope

- Email/password authentication and session management.
- Manual flashcard CRUD with inline validation (200/500 char limits).
- AI-assisted candidate generation triggered manually by the user.
- Review queue to accept, edit, or discard AI-generated candidates.
- Display of descriptive error messages; retry for AI failures.
- PostgreSQL persistence for user accounts and accepted flashcards only.

Out of Scope (MVP)

- Mobile apps (iOS/Android) and browser extensions.
- Analytics, usage tracking, or reporting on accept/edit/discard rates.
- Flashcard sets, tags, or grouping beyond a single flat per-user collection.
- Automatic AI generation or background generation.
- Final selection and integration of the spaced repetition algorithm.
- Collaboration, sharing, or multiplayer features.
- Localization and advanced accessibility beyond basic form semantics.

Assumptions and Dependencies

- Stable access to the chosen AI provider; failures are surfaced to users with retry.
- Minimalist UI suitable for internal demo.
- Future compatibility: database schema can be extended to support spaced repetition without migration complexity.
